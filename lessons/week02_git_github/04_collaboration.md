## üìñ L√Ω thuy·∫øt

### 1. Team Collaboration Models

#### **Centralized Workflow**
```
Central Repository (GitHub)
         ‚Üë‚Üì
    Developer A
         ‚Üë‚Üì  
    Local Repo A

         ‚Üë‚Üì
    Developer B  
         ‚Üë‚Üì
    Local Repo B
```

#### **Feature Branch Workflow**
```
main:     A---B---E---F---G
               \     /     \
feature-1:      C---D     
                           \
feature-2:                  H---I
```

#### **Gitflow Workflow**
```
main:     A-------E-------I
           \       \     /
develop:    \   C---D---F---G---H
             \ /         \ /
feature:      B           J---K
```

### 2. Pull Request Workflow

#### **Standard Process:**
1. **Fork/Clone** repository
2. **Create feature branch** from main
3. **Develop feature** v·ªõi focused commits
4. **Push branch** to remote
5. **Create Pull Request** v·ªõi description
6. **Code review** v√† discussion
7. **Address feedback** v√† update PR
8. **Merge** after approval

## üí° V√≠ d·ª• th·ª±c t·∫ø: Team Development Simulation

### **Scenario: 3-Person Team Game Development**

#### **Team Structure:**
- **Alice (Lead)**: Repository owner, code reviews
- **Bob (Backend)**: Game logic, AI implementation  
- **Charlie (UI)**: User interface, display formatting

### **Setup Team Repository**

#### **Alice (Repository Owner):**
```bash
# 1. Create v√† setup main repository
git clone https://github.com/alice/tick-tac-toe-team.git
cd tick-tac-toe-team

# 2. Setup branch protection rules on GitHub
# Settings > Branches > Add rule for main:
# - Require pull request reviews before merging
# - Require status checks to pass
# - Restrict pushes to matching branches

# 3. Add team members as collaborators
# Settings > Manage access > Invite collaborators
```

#### **Bob v√† Charlie (Team Members):**
```bash
# Option 1: Direct collaboration (if added as collaborators)
git clone https://github.com/alice/tick-tac-toe-team.git

# Option 2: Fork workflow (for open source)
# Fork repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/bob/tick-tac-toe-team.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alice/tick-tac-toe-team.git
```

#### **Review Comments Examples:**

**Constructive Feedback:**
```markdown
**Overall**: Great work on the AI implementation! The difficulty levels are well thought out.

**Specific Comments:**

Line 45: Consider adding input validation here:
```cpp
// Current
int AIPlayer::makeMove(const GameBoard& board) {
    // ...
}

// Suggestion
int AIPlayer::makeMove(const GameBoard& board) {
    if (!board.isValid()) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Invalid board state");
    }
    // ...
}
```

Line 78: This could be extracted to a helper function for better readability.

Line 102: Add comment explaining the heuristic scoring logic.

**Questions:**
- How does the AI handle draw situations?
- Should we add a timeout for the minimax algorithm?

**Approval:** ‚úÖ Looks good with minor changes requested.
```

### **Bob's Response to Review:**
```bash
# Address review comments
# Fix input validation, add comments, extract helper function

git add .
git commit -m "Address code review feedback

- Add input validation to makeMove method
- Extract heuristic scoring to helper function
- Add detailed comments for minimax logic
- Add timeout handling for complex scenarios"

git push origin feature/ai-player-implementation

# Comment on PR:
# "Thanks for the thorough review! I've addressed all the feedback:
# - Added input validation as suggested
# - Extracted helper function for better readability  
# - Added comprehensive comments
# - Included timeout handling for edge cases
# Ready for re-review!"
```

## ü§ù Handling Merge Conflicts

### **Scenario: Charlie's UI conflicts v·ªõi Bob's changes**

#### **Charlie's situation:**
```bash
# Charlie working on UI improvements
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-ui

# Meanwhile, Bob's AI feature gets merged to main
# Charlie's branch is now behind main

# Try to merge main into feature branch
git checkout feature/enhanced-ui
git merge main

# CONFLICT!
Auto-merging src/GameDisplay.cpp
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/GameDisplay.cpp
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

#### **Conflict Resolution Process:**

**1. Understand the conflict:**
```cpp
// src/GameDisplay.cpp
void GameDisplay::showBoard(const GameBoard& board) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    // Charlie's version - enhanced UI
    std::cout << "‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "‚ïë TIC TAC TOE   ‚ïë" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù" << std::endl;
=======
    // Bob's version - AI integration
    std::cout << "=== TIC TAC TOE GAME ===" << std::endl;
    if (hasAIPlayer) {
        std::cout << "Playing against AI (Level " << aiLevel << ")" << std::endl;
    }
>>>>>>> main
    
    // Display board grid...
}
```

**2. Communicate v·ªõi team:**
```markdown
**Slack/Discord message:**
Hey @Bob, I'm getting merge conflicts in GameDisplay.cpp. 
I see you added AI level display in the header. 
Can we combine both our changes? 
I'll integrate your AI info into my enhanced UI design.
```

**3. Resolve conflict:**
```cpp
// Combined solution
void GameDisplay::showBoard(const GameBoard& board) {
    // Charlie's enhanced UI with Bob's AI info
    std::cout << "‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "‚ïë TIC TAC TOE   ‚ïë" << std::endl;
    if (hasAIPlayer) {
        std::cout << "‚ïë vs AI Level " << aiLevel << "  ‚ïë" << std::endl;
    }
    std::cout << "‚ïö‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïù" << std::endl;
    
    // Display board grid...
}
```

**4. Complete merge:**
```bash
# Mark conflict as resolved
git add src/GameDisplay.cpp

# Complete merge
git commit -m "Merge main into enhanced-ui feature

Resolved conflicts in GameDisplay.cpp by combining:
- Enhanced UI formatting (Charlie)
- AI level display (Bob)

Both features now work together seamlessly."

# Push updated branch
git push origin feature/enhanced-ui
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Collaboration Issues

### **1. Merge conflicts due to poor communication**
```bash
# ‚ùå Problem: Two people working on same file without coordination
# ‚úÖ Solution: Regular communication, small focused changes
```

### **2. Inadequate pull request descriptions**
```markdown
‚ùå Bad PR description:
"Fixed stuff"

‚úÖ Good PR description:
"Implement AI player with difficulty levels

- Add AIPlayer class with minimax algorithm
- Support easy/medium/hard difficulty levels  
- Include comprehensive unit tests
- Update game loop to support AI vs human

Closes #15, addresses #12"
```

### **3. Not updating feature branches**
```bash
# ‚ùå Problem: Feature branch becomes stale
git checkout feature/old-feature  # 2 weeks old
git merge main  # Many conflicts!

# ‚úÖ Solution: Regular updates
git checkout feature/current-feature
git merge main  # Daily or every few days
```

---

## üí° Advanced Collaboration Tips

### **1. Automated Workflows**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup C++
      run: sudo apt-get install g++
    - name: Build
      run: make build
    - name: Test
      run: make test
```

### **2. Code Quality Tools**
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
# .githooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
# Run tests before commit
make test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

### **3. Documentation Standards**
```cpp
/**
 * @brief AI player implementation for Tic Tac Toe
 * 
 * Provides multiple difficulty levels using different algorithms:
 * - Easy: Random move selection
 * - Medium: Simple heuristics
 * - Hard: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
 * 
 * @author Bob Smith
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 2025-06-20
 */
class AIPlayer : public Player {
    // Implementation...
};
